This program checks for a previous instance of
the application. No matter where the exe is 
located, it detects it. It is not like the 
App.PrevInstance property.

It works by creating a "STATIC" window with a 
specific code as the caption.

If the function finds the window containing 
the code, then there is another instance 
running.

You can change the InstanceCode for any string
you want.

You don't need to call DestroyWindow API, since 
the window self destroys when the program is 
closed.
